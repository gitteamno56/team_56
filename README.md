# Post-Usage Return Fraud Detection System

## Brief Abstract

In the evolving landscape of online retail, a troubling trend has emerged â€“ customers placing orders for products, utilizing them, and subsequently returning them. This practice, termed 'Post-Usage Return Fraud,' involves customers acquiring items for specific needs, often single-use, and orchestrating returns by citing product defects or dissatisfaction. Our project aims to tackle this challenge by developing a machine-learning framework that effectively identifies fraudulent return requests from legitimate ones.

## High-Level Architecture

Our chosen approach to address this issue is the Bagging Random Forest technique. Bagging Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees, each trained on different data subsets (Bagging). This technique introduces feature randomness by considering only random feature subsets at each tree split (Random Forest). The final prediction is derived through voting (classification) or averaging (regression) of individual tree outputs. This approach mitigates overfitting, enhances accuracy, and strengthens model robustness.

## Implementation 

### Dataset Overview

Our dataset comprises detailed order information from a retail company, encompassing buyer details, product specifics, shop information, order numbers, and order statuses.

### Data Preprocessing

To prepare the data for analysis, we will undertake several preprocessing steps:

1. Removing the rupees symbol
2. Handling NaN values
3. Converting integers to float where necessary

### Data Visualization

We will conduct data visualization operations to gain insights into the features of our dataset in relation to target values. This exploration will help us identify the significant features in our data.

### Label Encoding

Categorical columns will be converted into numerical values via label encoding. This transformation facilitates subsequent operations.

### Data Splitting

We will divide the dataset into training and testing subsets, a crucial step in evaluating model performance.

### Feature Selection

Using suitable machine learning libraries, we will perform feature selection based on variance as a selection criterion. This step aids in optimizing model efficiency.

### Bagging Random Forest Model

We will employ the Bagging Random Forest model to process our preprocessed data. This model is expected to exhibit improved accuracy and robustness due to its ensemble nature.

### Model Evaluation

We will assess the model's performance through various accuracy metrics, enabling us to gauge the effectiveness of its predictions.

### Fraud Detection Mechanism

Our machine learning model will identify potential fraud by detecting anomalous spikes in returns from specific customers or a disproportionately high volume of returns to particular stores, indicating potential fraudulent activities at those locations.
